This Python script provides a command line interface for scheduling and managing processes using the subprocess module. With this script, users can easily schedule programs to run at specific intervals or run them manually.


To run the Example.py file every 5 minutes, you can use the command line interface provided by the scheduler.py script. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Make sure you have both scheduler.py and Example.py in the same directory.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where both files are located.

3. Type 'python scheduler.py' followed by the path to Example.py and the desired interval time (in seconds) separated by spaces. 
In this example, we want to run Example.py every 5 minutes, so we'll use:
```python scheduler.py Example.py 300```

4. Press enter to run the command.

The script will now schedule Example.py to run every 5 minutes. You can close the terminal or command prompt window and the script will continue running in the background.

That's it! Your program will now run automatically every 5 minutes thanks to the scheduler.py script.
